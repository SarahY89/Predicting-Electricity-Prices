# Predicting-Electricity-Prices

# Dataset Description
The dataset provided for this challenge comprises daily data for England and Scotland, including weather measurements (temperature, rain, wind), energy production information (changes in commodity prices), and electricity usage details (consumption, exchanges between the two countries, import-export data with the rest of Europe). The goal is to use these explanatory variables to estimate the daily price variation of electricity futures contracts, which are financial instruments that provide an expected value on the future price of electricity under current market conditions.
